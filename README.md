Infinite TicTacToe
Infinite TicTacToe is an extended version of the traditional TicTacToe game that allows for an infinitely expandable grid. This project is written in Python using the Pygame library to handle graphics and user input.

Key Features
  Infinite Grid: Unlike the traditional 3x3 grid, this game allows for an infinitely expandable grid, enabling more complex and extended gameplay.
  NO DRAW: This runs untill somewin no draw is possible. it will keep erasing the old XO.
  Player Tracking: Keeps track of player moves and switches turns between 'X' and 'O'.
  Win Checking: Implements logic to check for winning conditions horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  Graphical Interface: Uses Pygame to render the grid, player moves, and winning messages.
  Code Structure

The project consists of the following key files and components:

main.py: Contains the main game loop, event handling, and primary game logic.
header.py: Defines utility functions such as creating the grid and handling rectangles.
grid.py: Manages grid-related functions like checking for wins and initializing the grid.

Future Enhancements
  Implementing an AI opponent.
  Adding more visual effects and animations.
  Optimizing the code for better performance.
